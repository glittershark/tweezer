**Tweezer** is a CLI tool for editing your Gemfile.

Tweezer is currently usable, but should be considered a WIP in that it's
reasonably untested and might muck up your Gemfile in any number of nasty ways
(which is irrelevant if your Gemfile is in source control (and if it's not
what're you doing with your life)), and that it doesn't actually provide for the
use-case that I started writing it for yet.

## Installation

```sh
gem install tweezer
```

## Usage

```sh
tweezer add rake # Adds rake to the end of the default group in your Gemfile

tweezer add rake '~> 0.9.6' # Adds rake ~> 0.9.6 to the end of the default group
                            # in your Gemfile

tweezer add rspec --group test # Adds rspec to the 'test' group in your gemfile.
                               # Tweezer will do this in a way that results in
                               # the most idiomatic possible Gemfile
```

For further documentation, run `tweezer help` and `tweezer help COMMAND`.

## Why?

[Gemrat][] exists and is pretty cool, but has two problems with it that prevent
it from serving my use-case:

1. It uses naÃ¯ve string-manipulation to edit the Gemfile. **Tweezer**, by
   comparison, uses the [parser][] and [unparser][] gems to do an actual
   modification of the AST of your gemfile. 

2. Gemrat only really satisfies the use-case of "install and save to Gemfile",
   covered by tools like `npm install --save` for other languages. **Tweezer**,
   by comparison, either allows or will allow much more advanced modifications
   of the gemfile, including adding gems to groups, deleting groups, modifying
   versions, sources, etc. of gems, and more.

My original use-case was for local-development of a gem that was used by one of
my apps, which required rather frequently switching my gemfile between `gem
'mygem', '~> 1.0.0'` and `gem 'mygem', path: '/path/to/local/gem'`.
